            <p>My name is Rachel. I went to college, got a degree, and then decided that I wanted to change my career.</p>
            <p>I have a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Forensic Science</strong> with a specialization in <strong>Forensic Chemistry</strong>.<br>
            Here is where I went to school...<br>

            <p>After college, I spent about 6 months trying to get a job. I had a couple interviews in the field of forensics that looked promising but ended up not working out, which was really discouraging.<br>
            I got a job in an oil testing lab and have been working there for the past two years. During that time, more jobs in forensics have come across my radar, but I haven't had the urge to apply for them. When I realized I didn't want to be a forensic chemist, I started feeling <em>very anxious</em>.</p>
            <p>So now what? I'm constantly reminding myself that it's okay to change your career! People do it every day. I want to attend a coding program. Until then, I'm teaching myself to code!</p>
